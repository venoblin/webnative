## About The Project

![Screenshot](images/demo.gif)

One of the challenges with building and contributing to open source software is that while many projects have amazing functionalities, they often miss out on reaching a wider audience due to lack of clear and user-friendly installation instructions. In addition, lack of efficient showcase of their use cases also contribute to the lower reach of these projects.

While there are ReadME templates that can help address this, the process of manually filling out these templates can be time-consuming and tedious. That&#39;s where our project makeread.me comes in.

Introducing makeread.me, an automated ReadMe Generator that can revolutionize how you create your project documentation. It is designed to:

- Save your valuable time enhancing your focus on development,
- Automate redundant tasks, and,
- Implement DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself) principles to your documentation.

It&#39;s free, open-source, and highly customizable. Feel free to modify our templates to fit your needs. If you find that a particular component is missing, you are more than welcome to contribute and expand the project.

We&#39;ve made it easy for you to contribute to the project by using Nunjucks and JSON templates for programmatic mapping. Enjoy the benefits of clear and concise project documentation with makeread.me!

### Built With

- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
- ![Bash](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash-4EAA25?logo=gnubash&logoColor=fff)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Yarn to be installed in your system. If you don&#39;t have it installed, you can follow these steps:

- Install qt6-qtwebengine

  ```sh
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

- Install qt6-qtbase

  ```sh
  yarn --version
  ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** 

  ```sh
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/venoblin/scripts
  ```

2. **Create settings file (for [ezdownloadsorter](https://github.com/venoblin/download-file-sorter))**

  ```sh
  cd scripts
  touch settings.json
  ```

1. **Modify `settings.json`** 

  ```json
  {
    "downloads": "/path/to/Downloads",
    "destinations": {
      ".file-extension": "/path/to/destination",
      ".file-extension": "/path/to/destination",
      ".file-extension": "/path/to/destination"
    }
  }
  ```

4. **Install scripts** 
  
  ```sh
  ./install.sh
  ```
